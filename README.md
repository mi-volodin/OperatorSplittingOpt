# OperatorSplittingOpt

This is an approach for implementation of Block Splitting algorithm (by Neal Parikh and Stephen Boyd). 
Currently it is an auxiliary project to support my scientific research, but who knows.

The problem is as follows:

fx + gy -> min

Ax = y

x in [xmin, xmax]

subset of x is integer
